### Introduction
What do you think of when the months go by and we finally reach November? Thanksgiving? Fall?
Personally, for me, November has been extra days off school, some thanksgiving KFC dinner with family, but also **elections**. Keeping up with the daily news on how each of the candidates are fighting on each state's polls has been pretty exciting for me; so for the year of 2020, I will be creating data visualizations and blog posts following the directions, twists, and turns of this presidential election!
Now, lets begin the countdown to the election.
#### Presidential Vote Share History
Tracking presidential vote share data from 1928-2016, it’s clear that the polls fluctuate widely year to year with the United States’ two-party system (Figure 1: Presidential Vote Share). A large chunk of voters do not seem to carry preferences towards specific parties during the presidential elections observing how easily the popular vote switches from party to party every 4 years. This is exhibited especially on the years of 1964 to 1972, where party preferences switched drastically from each election cycle.

However, as we get closer to the present, the margin of victory over the popular vote appears to be decreasing. This suggests that party identification seems to play a larger influence on each individual’s voting preference for the presidency. Due to these changes, there can be some unforeseen changes within the relationships we see between the electoral college and the popular vote when the popular vote win ratios are on the much smaller side.
